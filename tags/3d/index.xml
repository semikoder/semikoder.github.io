One Room Survival is a game that I started making after I published Sketch Hero. After careful consideration, I decided to make a PC game. Possibly also port it to Android, if the impressions of the game are good. Something that I had to consider while planning the project was marketing. In the beginning, I also had no idea where to exactly publish my game. Steam, a huge game &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo;, which is commonly used by most of the gamers, was not an option for me personally, as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for the fee that&amp;rsquo;s required for me to publish the game on Steam.</description>

Keep in mind I&amp;rsquo;m writing this a year after I stopped making this game. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with portfolio or whatsoever back then.
Awaken Sentinel is the first game that I started making seriously on Unity game engine. It&amp;rsquo;s a multiplier FPS with open-world aspects. I can&amp;rsquo;t provide any further information to the game, nor the story, as the whole project started just because I wanted to learn something and I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on publishing at all/have the finished product.</description>
